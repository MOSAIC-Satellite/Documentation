# Contributing

Contributing is as easy as writing markdown. If you would like to see your changes locally, you can run a mkdocs server by following these steps:

1. Create your venv `python3 -m venv venv`
1. Activate your venv `. venv/bin/activate`
1. Install the python dependencies `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`
1. Run the local server `mkdocs serve`
