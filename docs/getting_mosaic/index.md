MOSAIC is an example of open-source hardware, which means all design files, schematics, and documentation for MOSAIC are freely available online. 

Anyone can use these files and, following the instructions found on this site, fabricate their own MOSAIC satellite system. 

!!! tip "Coming Soon"
    We are currently working on offering pre-built MOSAIC kits that can be ordered online and shipped directly to you. This will be an excellent option for those who don't have all the equipment needed to create the pieces of the MOSAIC satellite system. We hope to have these kits available for purchase by the end of 2025.
