MOSAIC is an example of open-source hardware, which means all design files, schematics, and documentation for MOSAIC are freely available online. 

Anyone can use these files and, following the instructions found on this site, fabricate their own MOSAIC mocksat. 

!!! tip "Coming Soon"
    We are currently working on offering pre-built MOSAIC kits that can be ordered online and shipped directly to you. This will be an excellent option for those who don't have all the equipment needed to assemble their own MOSAIC mocksat. We hope to have these kits available by the end of 2025.
