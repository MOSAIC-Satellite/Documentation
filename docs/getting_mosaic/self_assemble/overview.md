Using its freely available design files, you can make your own MOSAIC mocksat. This guide walks you through how to do this step-by-step. 

!!! note "Off the beaten path"
    Being open-source means you can make any modifications you wish. If you feel comfortable enough, don't be afraid to make changes! For example, you don't have to use the same companies or tools mentioned in this guide.

### Steps For Making Your Own MOSAIC

The four steps for making your own MOSAIC mocksat are outlined below.

!!! info "Before you begin"
    Some of the steps outlined below require specific equipment to be completed. Before you begin, it's recommended that you first read about the required equipment for each step to ensure you have everything you need.

#### [1. Fabricate Circuit Boards:](https://www.mosaicsat.org/getting_mosaic/self_assemble/fabricate_boards/)

There are three printed circuit boards (PCBs) that make up the internals of the MOSAIC. You can learn more about these boards in the [MOSAIC elements](https://www.mosaicsat.org/overview/mosaic_elements/) page of the overview section of this site. 

This first step guides you through setting up a PCB manufacturer to fabricate and assemble all three MOSAIC boards. 

#### [2. Purchase Components:](https://www.mosaicsat.org/getting_mosaic/self_assemble/purchase_components/)

In step one above, the three boards of MOSAIC will be almost completely assembled by the PCB manufacturer. However, some components will still need to be assembled by hand onto the boards.

This step guides you through the process of purchasing the components that will be assembled by hand. This step also discusses purchasing the optional components for MOSAIC, including the choices for your mocksat's processor, sensors, and more. 

#### [3. Assemble Boards:](https://www.mosaicsat.org/getting_mosaic/self_assemble/assemble_boards/)

This step guides you through the assembly needed for MOSAIC's boards that the PCB manufacturer didn't already do in step 1. 

#### [4. Print Frame:](https://www.mosaicsat.org/getting_mosaic/self_assemble/print_frame/)

This final step guides you through using a 3D printer to make the frame of the MOSAIC mocksat. Don't have a 3D printer? That's ok! This step also guides you through what to do when you don't have your own printer.

### How Much Will This Cost?

It's hard to provide a definitive number for the cost of making your own MOSAIC. Many variables can differ from user to user, including shipping costs, equipment you may or may not already own, and changes in prices over time. 

Each step listed above includes an estimated cost for completing that step. Please note that this is a rough estimate and may vary for you. These estimates also don't include the cost of the equipment needed for assembly, only for the pieces of MOSAIC itself.
