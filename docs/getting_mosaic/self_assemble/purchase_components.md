In the previous step of the MOSAIC self-assembly guide, you set up an order with JLCPCB to get the main boards of MOSAIC fabricated and assembled.

While JLCPCB will assemble most components on the boards, there are a few that will still need to be added by hand. There are also a few items that need to be purchased for the rest of the MOSAIC system. This step in the MOSAIC self-assembly guide will guide you through purchasing everything needed for a complete MOSAIC kit.

### I. Purchase components using the MOSAIC BOM spreadsheet

All components required to assemble a MOSAIC satellite kit can be found in the [MOSAIC bill of materials (BOM)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xMUYyzwjdTFx7HzwNHd50U6s08wMuClfGDR2PERgSA4/edit?usp=sharing). 

Use this spreadsheet to order the necessary items to complete your kit. The quantity listed for each item is sufficient for one MOSAIC kit.

### II. Purchase compatable modules

In addition to the items listed in the MOSAIC BOM above, you will need to purchase compatible components to use with your MOSAIC satellite. This includes processors and sensors.

MOSAIC is entirely compatible with the [Sparkfun MicroMod](https://www.sparkfun.com/micromod) line of processors and function boards. Likewise, their line of [Qwiic-compatible sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/sensors.html) can also be used with MOSAIC's ProtoBoard. 

Purchase at least one MicroMod processor and whichever sensors you would like to include with your satellite. 

!!! note "What's the bare minimum needed?"
    It's recommended that you acquire more than a few processors and sensors to maximize the benefits of the MOSAIC system. However, if you're looking for just a starting point, the following is what's recommended to get started:

    - 1x MicroMod processor (The [RP2040](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-micromod-rp2040-processor.html) or the [ESP32](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-micromod-esp32-processor.html) are great options to start with)
    - 1x any Qwiic compatible sensor from Sparkfun (the [LSM6DSO 6DoF Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-micromod-esp32-processor.html) is a good one to start with)
