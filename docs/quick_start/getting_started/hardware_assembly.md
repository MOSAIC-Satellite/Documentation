### :octicons-arrow-right-24: Attach brackets to MOSAIC boards

Each of MOSAIC's core PCBs (Main Board, Power Board, and ProtoBoard) requires two brackets to be attached to it. (Figure 12) These brackets will secure the boards to MOSAIC's frame. 

To attach these brackets:

1. Starting with any of MOSAIC's core boards, place a bracket on either side of the board at the flat edge of the board's outline so that the holes of the bracket line up with the holes of the board. 

    The flat edge of the bracket should be flush with the flat edge of the board. (Figure 13)

    !!! info "Brackets have two different pairs of holes"

        If you notice the bracket's holes don't align with the holes on the board, try flipping the bracket to the other side. The brackets have two pairs of holes for mounting to MOSAIC's boards and frame, respectively. These pairs of holes have different spacing.  

2. Secure the bracket to the board using the plastic screws and nuts from [MOSAIC's BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xMUYyzwjdTFx7HzwNHd50U6s08wMuClfGDR2PERgSA4/edit?usp=sharing). (Figure 14) Â 

3. Place another bracket on the same side of the board but opposite edge and secure it to the board with plastic screws and nuts. (Figure 15)

4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 above for the two other MOSAIC core boards. 

??? tip "Tip: Start securing boards to frame"

    Before continuing with your satellite assembly and connecting everything, it may help to secure MOSAIC's three core boards to one of the x-y face pieces of MOSAIC's frame (see the image below). 

    This is based on preference. Some may secure the boards to the frame piece now to determine how everything will fit together, while others prefer to keep their boards off the frame until the end for easy access.
