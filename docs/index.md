# Welcome to MOSAIC

MOSAIC, or *Modular Orbital Satellite for Advanced Innovation and Curriculum*, is an open-source, modular satellite platform designed to advance space technology education and accelerate satellite mission design.

## What is MOSAIC?

MOSAIC is a demonstrator satellite, or “mocksat,” that uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and a modular hardware ecosystem to make satellite technology accessible, affordable, and adaptable for educational institutions and research teams.

A mocksat has all the functionalities of a space satellite without the high cost and other challenges associated with “space-ready” satellites. Instead of going to space, this mocksat is intended to help teach satellite mission design or to be a prototyping platform for a satellite that will leave Earth’s atmosphere.

With MOSAIC, you can build a satellite that meets your mission's needs. Everything on MOSAIC, from its processor to its sensors, can be customized through easily swappable modules. This customizability allows students and developers to learn about each part of a satellite and the importance of selecting the right component for their mission.
