## What is MOSAIC?

MOSAIC is a demonstrator satellite, or “mocksat,” that uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and a modular hardware ecosystem to make satellite technology accessible, affordable, and adaptable for educational institutions and research teams.

As a mocksat, MOSAIC can be used as an educational tool to teach students about satellite mission design and hardware. The MOSAIC system can also serve as a prototyping platform for testing and building space mission hardware. MOSAIC's Main Board can also serve as a scientific payload control board and will be utilized in a CubeSat mission scheduled to launch in Q2 2026.

With MOSAIC, you can build a satellite that meets your mission's needs. Everything on MOSAIC, from its processor to its sensors, can be customized through easily swappable modules. This customizability allows students and developers to learn about each part of a satellite and the importance of selecting the right component for their mission.
